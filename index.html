        <h2>Homelab — Personal Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my humble abode, where servers outnumber furniture and cables are considered home décor. I’ve built a fortress of tech in my own home, a local cloud infrastructure that’s so secure, even my cat has to ask for access. With a proxy server routing all traffic, my data is as locked down as Fort Knox, and sensitive info is safe from prying eyes. Forget relying on third-party clouds – my private cloud has everything I need: web apps, file storage, and media streaming. Who needs Netflix when you’ve got a home-grown streaming service, right?</p>
    
        <h2>MelPark — Masters Expo Project</h2>
        <p>Ever tried parking in Melbourne? It’s like playing a game of Tetris on hard mode. So, I created <strong>MelPark</strong> – an iOS app with AWS magic in the back that gives you live updates on parking availability in the city. Using machine learning to read parking signs like a pro and city sensors to track open spots, <strong>MelPark</strong> is here to make sure you spend less time circling and more time parking (and maybe grabbing coffee while you’re at it).</p>
    
        <h2>Website Development</h2>
        <p>I worked my digital wizardry to make sure Armada Solutions shines online, so now the website is as sleek as a tech startup's coffee machine. Check it out at <a href="https://www.armadasolutions.com.au" target="_blank">www.armadasolutions.com.au</a>. Just don't expect it to make your morning coffee... yet.</p>
    
        <h2>Network Security — Masters Project</h2>
        <p>I’ve spent quality time with DDoS and ransomware attacks (in a <em>safe</em> sandbox environment, of course). Armed with tools like nmap, Metasploit, and Nessus, I’ve become a cyber security ninja. If there’s a vulnerability to be found, you bet I’ll find it. My motto? Keep your networks secure, or at least make them sweat!</p>

        <h2>Cloud Whisperer</h2>
        <p>I've spent more time with cloud platforms than I have with actual clouds (and trust me, I've seen my fair share). Whether it's <strong>Amazon AWS</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, or <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>, I know how to make them work their magic. If you need me to launch something in the cloud, I’ve got it covered—no umbrella required.</p>
    
        <h2>Productivity Suite Guru</h2>
        <p>I’ve mastered productivity suites like <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong> and <strong>Google Workspace</strong> (formerly known as G Suite, before it got its cool new name). If you need help with spreadsheets, presentations, or scheduling that one meeting nobody really wants to attend... I’m your person. Just don’t ask me to set up the coffee machine—I'm better with bytes than beans.</p>

      <h3>Tech Support Superhero (Capes Optional)</h3>
      <p>I’ve spent my days saving Googlers from their tech nightmares—managing infrastructure, solving problems, and making sure everything runs smoothly. Whether it’s helping someone with a rogue printer or unraveling complex technical conundrums, I’ve got it covered (usually with a cup of coffee in hand). I’ve also created automation scripts in <strong>PowerShell</strong> and <strong>shell scripting</strong> to take the boring, repetitive stuff off my plate—because who has time for that when there’s troubleshooting to be done?</p>
  
      <h3>Mentor, Troubleshooter, and OS Whisperer</h3>
      <p>I’ve mentored fellow engineers on all things Google tech and, on top of that, juggled multiple operating systems like <strong>macOS</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>ChromeOS</strong>, and <strong>Windows</strong>. I guess you could say I’m an OS multitasker, ensuring no machine gets left behind. When I’m not helping engineers, I’m busy maintaining internal display systems and running my very own “lab network”—because nothing says “I’m prepared” like a dedicated troubleshooting playground.</p>
  
      <h3>Bug Hunter Extraordinaire</h3>
      <p>Bugs? I see them before they even have a chance to crawl under the radar. I proactively identify and report them in Google platforms to prevent any wider catastrophes. My goal? Squash bugs before they have a chance to send people into panic mode.</p>
  
      <h3>Machine Learning Maverick</h3>
      <p>Currently, I’m leading a team dedicated to machine learning model retraining, because, let’s be honest, machines need regular “maintenance” too. I’m also contributing to integrating and governing these models within Google’s workflows—think of it as setting up the best possible workspace for a team of AIs. It’s like teaching them to play nice with each other, but with more math and fewer snacks.</p>

      <h3>BAU Team Member (aka The Infrastructure Whisperer)</h3>
      <p>I’m the person behind the scenes making sure client infrastructures run like well-oiled machines. Whether it’s supporting or maintaining systems, I’ve got the tools and the skills to keep things humming smoothly. From integrating tech like <strong>Sophos</strong>, <strong>Fortinet</strong>, <strong>Firebox Watchguard</strong>, <strong>Symantec</strong>, <strong>Veritas</strong>, and <strong>Veeam</strong>, I work some serious cross-vendor magic to ensure everything plays nice together. Think of me as the tech mediator—keeping the peace when routers and firewalls start bickering.</p>
  
      <h3>Cloud Technologist Extraordinaire</h3>
      <p>When it comes to cloud technologies, I’ve got my head in the sky (but with a solid grounding in reality). With hands-on experience in <strong>Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong> services, I’ve helped clients navigate hybrid cloud environments with ease. I’ve utilized everything from <strong>S3</strong> to <strong>EC2</strong> to <strong>VPC</strong>, delivering cloud solutions that work so seamlessly, you'd think it was all just a matter of flicking a switch. Spoiler: it’s actually a lot of work, but don’t worry—I’m used to handling that.</p>

      <h3>IT Support Extraordinaire</h3>
      <p>I’ve provided IT support to clients so diverse, even my coffee machine gets confused. From managing inventory and service requests at <strong>NBN CO Australia</strong> to helping <strong>Asahi Beverages Ltd</strong> keep their drinks cold and their systems running, I've seen it all. Oh, and did I mention I’ve also helped <strong>McGrawHill Education</strong> and <strong>Ortho Clinical Diagnostics</strong> tackle tech problems, one incident at a time? If there’s a hardware issue or a software glitch, I’m there faster than a server reboot.</p>
  
      <h3>Tech Fixer, Migrator, and Trainer</h3>
      <p>I’ve been the go-to person for hardware and software problems, leading migration projects, and finding solutions to everything from faulty cables to full-on system meltdowns. I’ve trained new recruits in data center maintenance, passing on the sacred knowledge of cables, racks, and, most importantly, how to avoid spilling coffee on a server (trust me, it happens more often than you think).</p>
  
      <h3>Hardware Hero</h3>
      <p>I’ve worked with hardware from all the big names—<strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>HP</strong>, <strong>Lenovo</strong>, <strong>ASUS</strong>, and <strong>Toshiba</strong>—and let me tell you, I know which cables go where better than most people know their own phone number. I’ve also participated in commissioning and decommissioning projects in data centers, because when it comes to network and server components, I don’t just plug them in—I make sure they live their best lives (and retire gracefully when the time comes).</p>

      <h3>Technical Assistance Ninja for Loan Origination Systems</h3>
      <p>I’ve been the behind-the-scenes hero for a multi-state <strong>Loan Origination System (LOS)</strong>, swooping in to tackle support tickets with the urgency of a fire drill (because let’s be honest, they often feel like one). Whether it’s fixing a bug or solving a ticket that’s been simmering longer than leftover pizza, I’m on it to make sure customers stay happy and everything runs smoothly.</p>
  
      <h3>The One Who Keeps Things Running</h3>
      <p>When I’m not rescuing tickets, I’m deep in the trenches, conducting operational analysis and ensuring that servers across <strong>production</strong>, <strong>testing</strong>, and <strong>development</strong> environments are up and running like clockwork. I manage both the hardware and software side of things, ensuring that everything from code to hardware works together in perfect harmony (well, most of the time).</p>
